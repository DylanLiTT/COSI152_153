# Final Project Description

Our final project is an app building an online community where people in Waltham get updated information on COVID-19, food, houses for rent. 
App providing real-time information on the operating status of restaurants or grocery stores. They can also check the menu of the currently open ones.

For Housing, it will be in the form of a forum where users can fill out a form with info about their house that they want to lease.
And the info will be posted and other users can see it and contact the leaser.

For Restaurant, we will try to fetch info from Google for their operating status and menu.

For COVID-19, we also need the technique of fetching info.
